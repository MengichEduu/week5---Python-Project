This code demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in Python through the use of base classes and subclasses. It includes a base class for animals and a base class for vehicles, each with specific subclasses that implement their respective movement behaviors.

Structure
Animal Base Class: Abstract class for animals, defining a move method that must be implemented by subclasses.

Dog Class: Subclass of Animal that implements the move method to print "Running üêï".
Fish Class: Subclass of Animal that implements the move method to print "Swimming üêü".
Vehicle Base Class: Abstract class for vehicles, defining a move method that must be implemented by subclasses.

Car Class: Subclass of Vehicle that implements the move method to print "Driving üöó".
Plane Class: Subclass of Vehicle that implements the move method to print "Flying ‚úàÔ∏è".
Functionality
The demonstrate_movement function takes a list of moving objects and calls the move method for each object, showcasing polymorphism.

Usage
Create instances of the Dog, Fish, Car, and Plane classes.
Compile a list of these instances.
Call the demonstrate_movement function with the list to see the output demonstrating the different movement behaviors of each object.
